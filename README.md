# Knowledge Graph Q&A System

## Overview
The **Knowledge Graph Q&A System** is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with a structured knowledge graph to explore and query domain-specific information. This project leverages **LlamaIndex** for building and querying the knowledge graph and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language understanding and enhanced responses.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Easily ingest documents from various formats (PDFs, APIs, databases, etc.).
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build a dynamic knowledge graph for structured data representation.
- **Query Engine**: Perform natural language queries on the knowledge graph.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the relationships within the knowledge graph using libraries like NetworkX or D3.js.
- **LLM Integration**: Combine the graph with LLMs for context-aware and augmented query responses.
- **Web Interface**: Interact with the system through an intuitive web-based UI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI or another LLM provider (if using LLM features)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-graph-qa-system.git
   cd knowledge-graph-qa-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac or Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Data Ingestion
Place your documents in the `data/` folder or configure the script to ingest data from other sources. Run the data ingestion script:
```bash
python ingest_data.py
```

### 2. Build the Knowledge Graph
Build a knowledge graph from the ingested data:
```bash
python build_graph.py
```

### 3. Query the System
Launch the web interface or use the CLI to query the knowledge graph:
```bash
python query_system.py
```
For example:
```
> What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Response: [Graph-based and LLM-augmented answer]
```

### 4. Visualize the Knowledge Graph
Run the visualization script to explore the graph:
```bash
python visualize_graph.py
```
